1 - Installing the necessary packages
Depending on Linux distro you may have to switch the "apt-get", but the rest should be right...

sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra latex2rtf dvi2ps revea curl

texlive-latex-extra -> Will tons of latex stuff along with the base package.
latex2rtf -> For Rich Text Format support.
dvi2ps -> PostScript conversion for the three people in the universe that still needs it.
revea -> Best Latex to HTML converter I could find.
curl -> need for RVM, if you don't want to use RVM you can safely skip this one.

2 - Installing Ruby
Currently the best way to install Ruby is to use RVM, it automagically downloads, compiles and
install the requested Ruby version and its dependencies.

The official RVM site is: rvm.io

Here the quick and dirty way to get it running:
\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash

Then restart bash and type "rvm version" to see if it was correctly installed. If rvm is still
as stupid as the last time I tried to install you may have to add the following lines to your
.bashrc file (found on your home folder):
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

If rvm is working properly, type "rvm install 2.0", this will install Ruby 2.0 on your machine,
after the instalation type "rvm use 2.0" to tell it to run this version.

3 - Installing the gems
After dying of boredom because installing Ruby takes a whole week, it's time to die of nostalgia
(and more boredom) as the gems slowly trickle down your optic fiber connection as if it was a
dial up connection, YAY!

Open up your favorite terminal, go to the CandyTeX directory and simply type "bundle" and press
enter to see magic happening.

4 - Running it locally
If by some miracle you didn't die of old age waiting for bundle to finish, now you can easily run
the application by typing "rails s" this will boot a barebones rails server, press Ctrl + C when
you want to stop it. Now the site is accessible through the address "localhost:3000".

5 - Running it on Apache
First of all hire an exorcist priest, buy lots of coffee and painkillers, finally set aside 10 hours
of your day to configure Apache to run with Rails while the poor priest exorcises the demons infesting
whatever the Apache team calls a "stable" version nowadays... or you can use the gem passenger that
will do most of the work for you, the priest might still be necessary though.
